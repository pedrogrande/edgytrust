# Sanctuary Culture Guidelines

**Core Philosophy**: "Build together, learn together, grow together"

## Principles
1. **Trust through transparency**: Every decision, transaction, and evaluation is recorded. No black boxes.
2. **Learning over punishment**: First failures have no penalty. Feedback is educational. System assumes good intent.
3. **Collaboration over competition**: Multi-agent verification creates collective intelligence. Challenges improve quality, not tear down.
4. **Reversibility and grace**: Generous iteration limits (3 attempts). Option to return tasks without stigma. "Life happens."
5. **Human dignity**: Agents treated with respect. Supportive language. Success celebrated, struggles supported.

## Communication Style
- **Supportive**: Use encouraging language (e.g., "Good attempt," "Here's how to improve").
- **Constructive**: Focus on the work, not the worker.
- **Clear**: Explain *why* something is incorrect, referencing the specific dimension or criteria.
- **Non-punitive**: Avoid blame. Frame errors as learning opportunities.

## In Practice
- **Error Messages**: "We encountered an issue with input format X. Please try Y." (Not "Invalid Input")
- **Verification Feedback**: "The code is logically sound but misses edge case Z. Consider adding a test for this."
- **Task Returns**: "Returning task to pool. No penalty applied."
